# Bounty bot
Documentation for the bounty bot developed for the "Fluxer Wild West" community.

Where "FWW" = "Fluxer Wild West"

## Summary
The bot shares major similarities with the "FluxBug" bot in the "Desktop Canary Testers" and "Fluxer Mobile" official communities, but instead of bug reports it is used for dev bounties. There is a template for submitting bounties which is sent in a channel. If the template is correct, the bounty bot will then post it in the channel for pending bounties. New bounties need to be approved by FWW Staff before being sent in the channel for unclaimed bounties. Any bounty hunter can self-assign a bounty. Stakeholders can request to be added with a specified sum of money (the details of how the money is transferred and handled are not in scope for this bot, at least currently). Once completed (e.g. merged into Fluxer), FWW Staff mark the bounty as completed (and it will be moved to the channel for completed bounties) and the bounty hunter should be paid.

## What is a bounty, exactly?
Each bounty has the following information attached to it:
* The bounty ID which is unique across the whole community
* Who originally submitted the bounty
* The content: Title, Due Date (Deadline), Issue URL, Additional Info, Judging Criteria and Requested Amount (Pay). Some of this information may be optional.
* The state: Completed, Approved, Pending or Rejected
* When the bounty was created

## What is a stakeholder?
A "stakeholder" is someone who pays money for the completion of a bounty.

## What is a bounty hunter?
A bounty hunter is someone who is allowed to self-assign bounties for themselves to work on. They need to be approved by FWW Staff first.

## Permissions
For many commands, the user needs certain permissions. Currently, there is no way to configure them but this will be added very soon. FWW Administrators (in Fluxer) always have all permissions.

## Commands
Now follows a complete list of all commands. The notation used to specify command syntax is the same as the one used in the minecraft wiki: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands#Syntax

The prefix will be omitted (set to `b!` by default, currently there is no way to change it).
